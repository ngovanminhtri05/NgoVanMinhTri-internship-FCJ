# Summary Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS"

### Event Objectives

- **Introduction to Foundation Models:** Understanding the core concepts of FMs.
- **Prompt Engineering:** A guide to effective prompting techniques.
- **Amazon Bedrock Exploration:** Deep dive into Generative AI using Amazon Bedrock.
- **RAG Architecture:** Understanding Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Knowledge Base integration.

### Speakers

- Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi
- Lam Truong Kiet
- Dinh Le Hoang Anh

### Key Highlights

#### Prompting Techniques
- Strategies to craft effective prompts that yield more accurate and context-aware results.

#### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Enhancing AI capabilities by embedding external data sources.
- Enables the model to respond with accurate, real-time information derived from internal/proprietary data.

#### Embeddings
- **Definition:** The numerical representation of text (vectors) that captures semantics and relationships between words.
- **Functionality:** Embedding models capture the features, context, and nuances of the input text.
- **Comparison:** Rich embedding models allow for semantic text similarity comparisons.
- **Multilingual Support:** Capable of identifying meaning and relationships across different languages.

#### featured AWS AI Services
- **Vision & Document Analysis:** Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Textract, Amazon Lookout.
- **Language & Speech:** Amazon Translate, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Polly, Amazon Comprehend.
- **Search & Data:** Amazon Kendra, Amazon Personalize.

### Key Takeaways

#### Prompting Techniques - Chain of Thought
- **Contextual Examples:** Providing the AI with specific use-case examples (few-shot prompting).
- **Step-by-Step Logic:** Instructing the AI to break down the problem-solving process into sequential steps to improve reasoning.

#### RAG Use Cases
- **Accuracy:** Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in recent, verified enterprise data.
- **Chatbot Enhancement:** Improves chatbot capabilities by integrating real-time data access.
- **Personalization:** Enables search functionality based on user history and specific personas.
- **Data Extraction:** Retrieving and summarizing specific transactional details from large datasets.

#### Amazon Titan Embeddings
- **Function:** Translates text inputs (words, phrases) into numerical vectors.
- **Advantage:** Comparing embeddings produces significantly more relevant and context-aware responses than simple keyword matching.
- **Specs:**
    - **Max Tokens:** 8,000
    - **Output Vectors:** 256, 512, 1,024
    - **Language Support:** Multilingual (100+ languages in preview)
