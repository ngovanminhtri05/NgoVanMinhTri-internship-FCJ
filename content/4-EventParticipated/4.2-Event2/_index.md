### Key Highlights

#### DevOps Mindset
- **Core Values:** Collaboration, shared responsibility, and breaking down silos.
- **Automation:** The goal is to "automate everything."
- **Culture:** Continuous learning, experimentation, and data-driven measurement.

#### The DevOps Journey Guide
- **Do:**
  - Start with fundamentals.
  - Learn by building real-world projects.
  - Document everything you do.
  - Master one concept/tool at a time.
  - Enhance soft skills (communication/collaboration).
- **Don't:**
  - Stay in "tutorial hell" (learning without doing).
  - Copy-paste code blindly without understanding.
  - Compare your progress to others.
  - Give up after initial failures.

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Lifecycle:** Understanding the full application lifecycle from coding, testing, and code review, to pre-prod and final production environments.

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Concept:** Managing cloud resources via code rather than manual GUI clicks.
- **Benefits:** Automatically create, update, and delete infrastructure with consistency.
- **Tools:** Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi.

#### Container Services on AWS
- **Ecosystem:** Managing containers using Docker, Kubernetes, Amazon ECR, and Amazon EKS.
- **Amazon App Runner:** A fast, simple, and cost-effective service to deploy web applications directly from source code or container images without managing servers or configuring infrastructure.

#### Monitoring & Observability
- Implementing best practices using **Amazon CloudWatch** and **Amazon X-Ray** to ensure system health and traceability.

### Key Takeaways

#### DevOps Metrics
- **Purpose:** To monitor deployment health, improve agility, ensure system stability, optimize customer experience, and justify technology investments.

#### The "Continuous" in CI/CD
- Gained a comprehensive view of the full CI/CD pipeline process (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment).

#### IaC in AWS
- Utilizing **Amazon CloudFormation** to create templates with defined services and parameters for repeatable deployments.

### Applying to Work

- **Career Path:** Develop a structured roadmap for a DevOps career.
- **Implementation:** Apply CI/CD pipelines to current active projects.
- **Optimization:** Build reusable IaC templates to reduce human error in infrastructure management.

### Event Experience

Attending the **“DevOps on AWS”** workshop was extremely valuable. It provided me with a clear career guide, essential tools, and foundational knowledge. Key experiences included:

#### Insights from Highly Skilled Speakers
- FACJ experts shared their personal experiences and daily realities of DevOps roles.
- Witnessed live demos of monitoring and observability in real-world projects.

#### Exploring CI/CD and IaC
- Learned how large enterprises update their production environments continuously through robust CI/CD pipelines.
- Understood how to use constructs, reusable patterns, and language support (via AWS CDK).
- Practical exposure to deploying resources with CloudFormation.

#### Monitoring and Observability
- Learned how to set up effective alerting, dashboards, and on-call processes.
