> Here, you can freely share your personal opinions about your experience participating in the First Cloud Journey program. This will help the FCJ team improve any shortcomings based on the following aspects:

### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
FCJ cultivates a welcoming and collaborative atmosphere where team members readily assist with challenges, even beyond regular hours. The workspace layout promotes concentration, though I believe periodic social events or team-building sessions could further enhance interpersonal connections among interns and staff.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor consistently delivers thorough instruction, breaks down complex concepts when I struggle, and actively fosters a question-friendly culture. The administrative team streamlines logistical needs and ensures access to essential resources. I particularly value the mentor's coaching style—encouraging independent problem-solving before stepping in with solutions.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
Assigned projects bridge classroom theory and emerging industry practices effectively. I reinforced core academic concepts while exploring technologies and methodologies not covered in my coursework, achieving a balance between consolidation and expansion of my technical repertoire.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The internship exposed me to project management platforms, cross-functional collaboration techniques, and professional communication norms. My mentor's insights into career trajectory planning and real-world trade-offs proved invaluable for shaping my long-term goals.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
Mutual respect and shared purpose define the organizational culture. Team members maintain high standards while preserving an approachable environment. During critical sprints, colleagues coordinate across levels to meet deadlines, making me feel integrated rather than peripheral despite my intern status.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
FCJ offers a stipend and accommodates schedule adjustments when necessary. Access to internal training programs and knowledge-sharing sessions constitutes a significant perk that extends beyond typical internship offerings.
